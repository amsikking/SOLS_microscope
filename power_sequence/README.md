# Power ON:
1) **AO box** (NI PXIe-1073), upper shelf on the left, button on front (must be first)

3) **Laser box** (Coherent), on mini optical table (mounted on main table), button on front behind screen.
4) **Coherent GUI** to turn on 561nm laser if needed -> must _**close GUI afterwards!**_ (this must be next or the GUI upsets other devices!)
5) **Filter wheel** box (LAMBDA 10-3), lower shelf, button on front

Note: The **Okolabs** objective heater can be funky. Check the temperature on the screen with the 'magnifying glass'. If the temperature is not changing to reach the set point then try going to settings -> temperature -> objective heater and then hitting disable -> re-enable -> factory settings.

# Power OFF:
Everything in any order!
